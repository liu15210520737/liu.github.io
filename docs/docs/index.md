## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.

## Configuration

The `mkdocs.yml` file contains all the configuration for your documentation project.

```yaml
site_name: My Docs
nav:
    - Home: index.md
    - User Guide: user-guide.md
    - About: about.md
```

The `site_name` variable sets the name of your documentation project. The `nav` variable defines the structure of your site and the order in which the pages are displayed. Each item in the `nav` list is a link to a markdown file. The key is the name of the link and the value is the path to the markdown file relative to the `docs` directory.  

## Writing your docs

MkDocs uses Markdown for writing your documentation. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to your text. You can use it to add headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, code blocks, and more.

### Headings

To create a heading, add a `#` symbol followed by a space and the heading text. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the level of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

### Paragraphs

To create a paragraph, just add some text. Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

```markdown
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
```

### Lists

To create a list, use the `-` or `+` symbol followed by a space for each item in the list.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

To create a nested list, indent the items by four spaces or one tab.

```markdown
- Item 1
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
- Item 2
```

### Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then add the URL in parentheses.

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Images

To add an image, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](image.jpg)
```

### Code blocks

To add a code block, use the backtick (`) character at the beginning and end of the code block.

```markdown
```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
```


## Building your site

To build your site, run the `mkdocs build` command in your terminal. This will generate a directory named `site` that contains all the HTML files for your site. You can then use a web server to serve these files or deploy them to a static hosting service. 

## Deploying your site

To deploy your site, you can use a web hosting service like Netlify or GitHub Pages. These services provide a simple way to deploy your documentation site. You can also use a third-party service like ReadTheDocs to host your documentation.

## Conclusion

MkDocs is a fast, simple and powerful static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. It has many features including auto-generated navigation, search, and support for multiple languages.

Overall, MkDocs is a great choice for building project documentation and it's easy to use and customize.

Happy writing!
